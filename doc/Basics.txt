Some basics regarding coordinates in OpenConfiguration

The coordinate system is the OpenGL one, where
x points to the right,
y points up,
z points towards the reader   

The UV coordinates start at the lower left corner like that:
0,1               1,1

 |
0,0---------------1,0

Quaternions, Matrices etc. are designed to be used like the three.js Webgl library does its basic operations.
So if in doubt you can actually use three.js to get examples of transformations etc.

Empty lists and empty dictionaries are explicitly allowed. Unlike the GLTF spec that forbids empty lists.
